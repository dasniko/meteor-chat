MeteorChat
==========

Simple chat application with different chat-rooms built on the [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) JavaScript Platform.

Not much functionality, only to demonstrate how _simple_ it is to set up a reactive app using Meteor.

Used add-on packages (for convenience only!):

* `bootstrap` for beautifying the UI
* `accounts-password` and `accounts-ui` for having the user authenticated right out of the box

Application is deployed at <http://chat.n-k.de>

Feel free to fork/copy/whatever...
